    <h2>Explaination</h2>
    <p>
        This is what I use to create my music |  <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/logic-pro-x/id634148309?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI5tba5bS36gIVBI_ICh2QswxJEAAYASAAEgLcMvD_BwE&ign-itscg=20200&ign-itsct=rv_LPX_google&mt=12&mttnagencyid=2433&mttncc=US&mttnpid=305109&mttnsiteid=141192&mttnsub1=EAIaIQobChMI5tba5bS36gIVBI_ICh2QswxJEAAYASAAEgLcMvD_BwE&mttnsub2=c-1750984295-ag-67301574143-ad-433699244582-k-kwd-302610260132&mttnsubad=67301574143&mttnsubsite=AppleLogicPro" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Music Software" style="color:red">Logic Pro X</a> | I believe you can only get Logic Pro X by having an Apple product. The music software is pretty unique. I start off creating a song by creating the beat first. I create my own beats and also using sample loops to create a song. Once the song beat is completed, I start writing lyrics for the song. I will create the lyrics until I can't think of anymore lyrics for the song, then I will repeat the lyrics that I made and the beat with it. After I repeat the lyrics, then I will continue with new lyrics right after where I left off until I can't think of anymore lyrics. Then I keep repeating the process over and over again until I'm finished with the song. I don't finish a whole song in one day. It all depends how busy I am with school and work. Sometimes, I can finish all the lyrics of a song in less than a month, but it could also take longer than a month. Once the lyrics are completed, I'll start mastering the song. I will change how certain tunes sound and also my voice to sound better. I will also change certain volumes of tunes and the volume of my voice so it can sound more clear. Once it sounds perfect, I will post the song on my Soundcloud.

    I have different type of moods when creating my music. Most of the moods are motivating and sadness. That's what I like to express when creating a song. I'm referring to how someone can feel. The motivation is from people doubting me and having fear of losing. The sadness can be from loneliness and thinking my music will never be accomplished.
