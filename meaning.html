    <h2>Explaination</h2>
    <p>
        The Weeknd & Eminem are artists who inspired me to create music. Here are two of my favorite songs from them. | <a href="https://youtu.be/ZXBcwyMUrcU" style="color:red">YouTube</a> | <a href="https://youtu.be/S9bCLPwzSC0" style="color:red">YouTube</a> | I found myself loving music at ten years old. It started from listening to a couple songs from Eminem. I really liked his music, so I started listening to more. I eventually wanted to start creating music because of how much I love it. I started exploring more artists to listen to, such as Drake, The Weeknd, Lil Wayne, Tame Impala, and Logic. I listened to more artists over time. I was writing a lot of lyrics to many different beats when I was in middle school. I eventually started focusing on different things going to high school. I grew problems in life with sadness, family issues, and being lonely. It was a huge problem for me to have that in high school, but eventually I needed to cope with it. Going to my first concert which was The Weeknd definitely helped a little bit with the issues. I gained love for music again and reminded how much I was passionate for music.

        I wanted to actually start posting my own music online, but didn't know how. I later found out I can do it using an app on my phone which was called <b>Garageband.</b> I began to create music by creating beats and writing lyrics for them. I used my headphones as a mic. I noticed my depression was slowly going away because I distracted myself by creating music. It helped a lot and I was creating a lot of music. At first, my songs were pretty bad, but I gained more skills overtime after dropping multiple songs. I noticed my songs were slightly getting better over the years from practicing. I eventually had the money to afford a better music set up because I started working at sixteen years old. I bought a laptop for music and school, a good quality microphone, and a better music software for my laptop. My music gained better quality and I learned more skills with the extra features. I still create music and I will always keep creating more in the future and never give up. I'm also still focusing on school of course.
